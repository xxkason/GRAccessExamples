The primary implications of being UNSUPPORTED are:

1. These scripts have had LIMITED testing and may not work completely as intended and may have unintended side effects.
1. They include NO WARRANTY OF ANY KIND. Aveva assumes NO responsibility for these scripts or any unintended consequences of using them.
1. By using them, you assume FULL responsibility for the consequences.
1. The scripts/objects may fail to work following a product update (patch, service pack, major release) that makes changes to existing database objects.
1. Wonderware/Aveva assumes no responsibility to answer questions or assist with the use of the scripts themselves (although, to the degree they leverage standard product features, those are of course supported).
